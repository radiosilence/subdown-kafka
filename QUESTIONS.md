Questions
=========

Things I do not understand or need clarity on.

* Does my project layout look reasonable?
* How do I define an entry point for each "microservice"
* How can I have something both start a Ratpack HTTP server and also initialise a kafka connection and post things to it?
* Do I have to define an object for every single JSON response with Ratpack?
* Can I declare a kafka setup (topics etc) in a config file and have it spun up as opposed to doing this manually?
